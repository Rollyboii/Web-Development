                <h4>Gon</h4>
                <p>Gon is an athletic, rustic, and friendly boy who is searching for adventure. Also, he is not very good at math. However, having spent a lot of time in the woods as a child, he is very good with animals. Gon is an Enhancer, who are known for being simple-minded and determined. This determination and talent lead to both potential allies and potential enemies trusting in him and taking his side. He has inhuman senses; Gon has a heightened sense of smell almost like a dog's, he also has very good vision, as well as having a very keen taste. Gon wants to become a Hunter because he wishes to find out the depths of an occupation that would cause a father to choose the profession over being with his own son.
                    Simultaneously, his flaws lie in his temper and impulsive nature. Gon sometimes fails to think things through and such actions lead to him suffering. Though possessing talent far beyond the norm for his age, anytime his abilities are challenged, he feels as if he has to prove his antagonist wrong.</p>

                <h4>Kurapika</h4>
                <p>Kurapika has medium blond hair with brown eyes; blue in the 1999 anime adaptation (grey/dark grey in the 2011 anime adaptation). His eyes glow a beautiful and coveted scarlet when experiencing intense emotion. In his first appearance in the series, he wears a blue tabard decorated with an orange-colored (red in the 2011 anime adaptation) hem and a white full-body training suit underneath. He changes his tabard and training suit for the duration of the Yorknew City arc. His shoes are Chinese-style winkle-picker flats. From the Election arc he wears a blue or black suit with dress shoes, and in some subsequent appearances, he also wears a necktie. From the Succession Contest arc, as a royal bodyguard, he wears a uniform consisting of a blue suit and tie with a gold capital H on the left breast of the blazer.
                    Kurapika also wears a single, drop earring ornamented with a ruby in his left ear. After learning Nen, he starts using black contact lenses in order to hide his Scarlet Eyes.</p>
